# Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning (AY 2023-24)

Welcome to the repository for the Numerical Analysis for Machine Learning course (AY 2023-24). This repository contains both the Jupyter Notebook and the project report.

## Quick Start

To get the most out of the Jupyter Notebook, we strongly recommend opening it in Google Colab. Colab offers a streamlined experience where non-relevant sections (like library installations and dataset generation) are collapsed, allowing you to focus on the essential parts of the project.

### Open in Colab

You can open the notebook directly in Colab by clicking the button/link provided at the beginning of the notebook
